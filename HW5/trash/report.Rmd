#IV. Computational Results
Overall, with **rank = 10**, across all 3 videos, we are able to separate the foreground (right) from the background (left). There are still some contours of the foreground residing in the extracted background, but those contours are completely unmoving.

In the corgi surveillance video **FIGURE**, we can easily separate out the foreground (the moving corgi) and the background (the kitchen). In the video, the only thing moving is the corgi, while the surrounding background (the kitchen) is completely still. However, while we can extract all the corgi's movement into a separate foreground, we are unable to extract a clearer shape of the moving corgi. We surmise that this might due to the poor quality of the surveillance camera: The video is very blurry, showing poor sharpness and contrast between objects.

In the boxing surveillance video **FIGURE**, the foreground is the two moving boxers, and the background is the audience. There are some slight movements in the background (e.g the referee walking back and forth). However the algorithm extracts  out a very clear representation and movement of the two fighters. 

In the corgi twerking video, the camera is moving so both the background and the foreground are moving. However the video quality is great, with clear sharpness and contrast between objects. The algorithm does a pretty good job separating out the main background, while still captures the shaking movement of the corgi.

#V. Summary and Conclusions

> The effectiveness of the algorithm is affected by 

> the quality of the movie clip: The boxing video has better quality e.g better light contrast. Whereas the corgi video has poorer quality where objects edges and contrasts are blurrier - the foreground seems "blend in" with the background, thus making it harder to extract a clear foreground. In the better video, the algorithm better separates the background and the foreground. The foreground is clearer. 

> Adding in the residuals into the X dmd low rank (the foreground) produces worse results.
