# AMATH482

Repository for AMATH 482: Computational Methods for Data Analysis. This class is an upper level course in the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington - Seattle. This repository houses all the reports written for the class's homeworks. The codes used for the data analysis are at the end of all the reports.

Class description:"Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis, spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing and compression."
